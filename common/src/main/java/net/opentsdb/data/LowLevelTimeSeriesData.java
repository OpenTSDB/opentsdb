/**
 * This is an interface used by parsers to allow a downstream data consumer to
 * iterate over a set of one or more incoming time series data payloads. E.g.
 * a metric collection agent can send a text payload over a message bus or 
 * web service and the implementation of this interface will take a reference to
 * the payload, send it on to the next hop. When the destination begins
 * iterating by calling {@link #advance()}, the implementation should start 
 * parsing the payload and return each unique time series found. This will let
 * us avoid creating garbage in the form of strings or buffer slices when we
 * don't need to.
 * <p>
 * This is the base identifier and iterator for various time series data
 * including metrics, annotions, histograms, etc. Each type of data should extend
 * this interface.
 * <p>
 * To use this consumer, first call {@link #advance()}. If the response is true
 * then there is a valid time series to consume. The timestamp can be fetched 
 * from {@link #timestamp()} and if there are tags then the 
 * {@link #advanceTagPair()} method can be called to iterate over the pairs. The 
 * extending interface implementation will have the typed time series data ready 
 * to consume.
 * <p>
 * Note that implementers must reset the tag iteration for each call to 
 * {@link #advance()} in situations where the payload shares a common tag set
 * for multiple data.
 * <p>
 * Note also that an implementation may implement multiple data types while
 * iterating if the payload has different data types. In such a case each type
 * should set a {@code <type>HasData()} flag. 
 * @since 3.0
