/**
 * An interface implemented by an upstream consumer or the final pipeline sink
 * to receive results from a query. This follows the observer pattern with the
 * following behavior for a chunked stream:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The sink or upstream will generally call {@code fetchNext()} on the 
 * pipeline.</li>
 * <li>The pipeline calls {@link #onNext(QueryResult)} with a result.</li>
 * <li>The sink calls {@code fetchNext()} again on the pipeline.</li>
 * <li>The pipeline either calls {@link #onNext(QueryResult)} with the next
 * result or {@link #onComplete()} to signal the end of the query.</li>
 * <li>The sink releases the query resources.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * If no data is available for a given query, {@link #onComplete()} may be 
 * called before {@link #onNext(QueryResult)}. 
 * <p>
 * If at any time, an exception occurs, {@link #onError(Throwable)} will be
 * executed by the pipeline. No further calls to any method of the listener 
 * will be made and the pipeline should be closed.
 * 
 * @since 3.0
