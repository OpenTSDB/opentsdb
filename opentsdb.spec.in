%description
OpenTSDB is a distributed, scalable Time Series Database (TSDB) written on top
of HBase. OpenTSDB was written to address a common need: store, index and
serve metrics collected from computer systems (network gear, operating
systems, applications) at a large scale, and make this data easily accessible
and graphable.

Thanks to HBase's scalability, OpenTSDB allows you to collect many thousands
of metrics from thousands of hosts and applications, at a high rate (every few
seconds). OpenTSDB will never delete or downsample data and can easily store
billions of data points.
