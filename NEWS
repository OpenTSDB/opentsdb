    having to modify the source code.

Bug Fixes:
  - OOM handling script now handles multiple TSDs installed on the same host.
  - Fix a bug where queries never return if an exception is thrown from the
    storage layer.

  - 

* Version 2.2.0 RC1 (2015-09-12)

Noteworthy Changes:
  - Add the option to randomly assign UIDs to metrics to improve distribution across
    HBase region servers.
  - Introduce salting of data to improve distribution of high cardinality regions
    across region servers.
  - Introduce query stats for tracking various timings related to TSD queries.
  - Add more stats endpoints including /threads, /jvm and /region_clients
  - Allow for deleting UID mappings via CLI or the API
  - Name the various threads for easier debugging, particularly for distinguishing
    between TSD and AsyncHBase threads.
  - Allow for pre-fetching all of the meta information for the tables to improve
    performance.
  - Update to the latest AsyncHBase with support for secure HBase clusters and RPC
    timeouts.
  - Allow for overriding metric and tag widths via the config file. (Be careful!)
  - URLs from the API are now relative instead of absolute, allowing for easier reverse
    proxy use.
  - Allow for percent deviation in the Nagios check
  - Let queries skip over unknown tag values that may not exist yet (via config)
  - Add various query filters such as case (in)sensitive pipes, wildcards and pipes
    over tag values. Filters do not work over metrics at this time.
  - Add support for writing data points using Appends in HBase as a way of writing
    compacted data without having to read and re-write at the top of each hour.
  - Introduce an option to emit NaNs or Nulls in the JSON output when downsampling and
    a bucket is missing values.
  - Introduce query time flags to show the original query along with some timing stats
    in the response.
  - Introduce a storage exception handler plugin that will allow users to spool or
    requeue data points that fail writes to HBase due to various issues.
  - Rework the HTTP pipeline to support plugins with RPC implementations.
  - Allow for some style options in the Gnuplot graphs.
  - Allow for timing out long running HTTP queries.
  - Text importer will now log and continue bad rows instead of failing.
  - New percentile and count aggregators.
  - Add the /api/annotations endpoint to fetch multiple annotations in one call.
  - Add a class to support improved bulk imports by batching requests in memory for a 
    full hour before writing.
  
Bug Fixes:
  - Modify the .rpm build to allow dashes in the name.
  - Allow the Nagios check script to handle 0 values properly in checks.
  - Fix FSCK where floating point values were not processed correctly (#430)
  - Fix missing information from the /appi/uid/tsmeta calls (#498)
  - Fix more issues with the FSCK around deleting columns that were in the list (#436)
  - Avoid OOM issues over Telnet when the sending client isn't reading errors off it's
    socket fast enough by blocking writes.

* Version 2.1.2 (2015-11-09)

Bug Fixes:
  - Fix the built-in UI to handle query parameter parsing properly (found when Firefox 
    changed their URI behavior)
  - Fix comments about the Zookeeper quorum setting in various config files.
  - Fix quoting in the Makefile when installing.
  - Make sure builds write files in the proper location on FreeBSD.

* Version 2.1.1 (2015-09-12)

Bug Fixes:
  - Relax the pgrep regex to correctly find and kill the java process in the RPM init.d
    script.
  - Improve query performance slightly when aggregating multiple series.
  - Fix the /api/search/lookup API call to properly handle the limit parameter.
  - Fix the /api/query/last endpoint to properly handle missing tsdb-meta tables.

* Version 2.1.0 (2015-05-06)

Bug Fixes:
  - FSCK was not handling compacted and floating point duplicates properly. Now they 
    are merged correctly.
  - TSMeta data updates were not loading the latest data from storage on response
  - The config class will now trim spaces from booleans and integers
  - On shutdown, the idle state handler could prevent the TSD from shutting down
    gracefully. A new thread factory sets that thread as a daemon thread.
  - TSMeta objects were not generated if multiple writes for the same data point arrived
    in succession due to buffering atomic increments. Increments are no longer buffered.
  - Updated paths to the deprecated Google Code repo for dependencies.

* Version 2.1.0 RC2 (2015-04-04)

Noteworthy Changes:
  - Handle idle connections in Netty by closing them after some period of inactivity
  - Support compressed HTTP responses

Bug Fixes:
  - Various RPM script and package fixes
  - Properly handle deletions of the cache directory while running
  - Queries for non-extant metrics now return a 400 error
  - Fix an issue with the meta sync utility where entries were not created if the counter existed
  - Report stats properly when the UID is greater than 3 bytes wide
  - Fix UI hangups when incorrect tags are supplied
  - Log illegal put exceptions at the debug level
  - Fix global annotation retrieval where some entries were missing
  - Fix unit tests that were not properly mocking out clients or threads and causing JVM OOMs
  - Fix accounting bugs in FSCK
  - Sort aggregators in the UI
  - Properly throw an exception if the user supplies an empty tag on storage or retreival
  - Handle missing directories in the Config class

* Version 2.1.0 RC1 (2014-11-09)

Noteworthy Changes:
  - Add a server side timeout for sockets that haven't written data in some time
  - Major FSCK utility update to handle new objects, delete bad data and deal with duplicate data points.
  - Optionally preload portions of the name to UID maps at startup
  - Add read and write modes to the TSD to disable writing data points via telnet or HTTP
  - Optionally disable the diediedie commands to prevent users from shutting down a tsd
  - Optionally block the auto creation of tag keys and values
  - Downsampling is now aligned on modulus bondaries so that we avoid interpolation as much as possible. Data returned is now more along the lines of what users expect, e.g. 24 data points for day when downsampled on hourly intervals instead of random points based on the span's timestamps.
  - Add the /api/search/lookup endpoint and CLI endpoint for looking up time series based on the meta or data tables
  - Rework of the TSD compaction code to process compactions faster
  - Optionally handle duplicate data points gracefully during compaction or query time without throwing exceptions
  - Add Allow-Headers CORs support

Bug Fixes:
  - Fix tree REST endpoint to allow modification of the strictMatch and storeFailure fields
  - Fix compacted millisecond columns throwing an error during fsck
  - Fix tsd startup directory permission checks
  - Fix thread safety of pending UID assignment when they are complete
  - Fix compaction queue flushing on tsd shutdown
  - Fix RTPublisher plugin floating point value detection where it was previously posting to the wrong method
  - Fix TsdbQuery.toString() to avoid looing up UIDs if an error was thrown as this can cause cause a deadlock

  - Add Travis CI build support
  - Update to Asynchbase 1.6.0 and update additional dependencies
  - Modify scripts to allow easier compilation under FreeBSD

    - max if missing min: returns the maximum value if a data point is missing
    - min if missing max: returns the minimum value if a data point is missing
  - New TSUID tracking that writes a counter to a new table to track the 
    different time series stored and how many data points were written
  - New meta data trees that allow for flattening time series into a 
    heirarchical representation similar to a file system
  - New meta and tree synchronization CLI tools
  - New statistics showing the number of UIDs used and available for each type
